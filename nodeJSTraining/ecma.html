    <h1>ECMA6 Specification</h1>
    <p> When Javascript started, each vendor like MIcrosoft, Google and other vendors had their own interpretation of the engines. To standardize it, an organization called ECMA stepped in and declared the specifications that these comapnies should stick to. Try to google ECMA 2015 to check the complete specification</p>
    <p>Any Javasacript engine that is written should stick to these specifications. V8 does that. It converts a code into a language that the processor can understand. Additionally, it should stick to the latest ECMA specifications on how the language should work and what features should it have</p>
