    <h1>V8 - The Javascript Engine</h1>
    <p> V8 is the base of NodeJS. Let's do a quick search - Chrome V8. Notice, I searched for Chrome V8. Why? Because V8 was primarily written for Google Chrome browser to be able to understand and compile Javascript</p>
    <p>You can downlad the code from GitHub and actually check the src folder. You will see the code for differnt machine languages. You will see a lot of .cc and .h files. All of these are a part of C++</p>
    <p>Look at date.cc. This is the module that handles dates because Javascript needs to handle dates.</p>
    <p>V8 is not a mystery box. It is just a lot of code designed to cocnvert Javascript in a language that your processor understands</p>
