    <h1>The Client-Server model</h1>
    <p> If you have likely used features like DOM manipulation, async operations and http calls with Javascript, it is provided by the V8 engine embedded in your browser. It is not a part of ECMA specification</p>
    <p>On the server-side, you have been using languages like PHP, Ruby, Java. The goal is to work with a unified language in both the ends - Server and client. This also ensures you can share libraries of code on the server and the client and of-course, you need to worry about only one programming language.</p>
