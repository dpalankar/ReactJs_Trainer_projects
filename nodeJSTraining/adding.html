    <h1>Adding features to Javascript</h1>
    <p> One of the most powerful features of V8 is that it can be embedded into any other C++ program. It provides hooks for accessing its core feature set. </p>
    <p>It might sound ordinary at first, but think about it - Now you can write functions and extend the functionality of Javascript. Think about it - JS was not supposed to deal with files or other system related stuff. It was supposed to run in a browser. But, with this feature, we can make it do things that are beyond the scope of ECMA specifications</p>
    <p>Let's look at a small example. Let's open shell.cc</p>
    <p>Observe the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>V8 is embedded into the code</li>
        <li>There are functions like 'print' and 'load'. If the V8 engine encounters this command in JS, it will run the following C++ function</li>
    </ul>
