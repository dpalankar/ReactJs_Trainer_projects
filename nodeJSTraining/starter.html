    <h1>Don't focus on imitating the code. Focus on learning</h1>
    <p>How often have you attended a training where you were completely able to follow the instructor and write the code along with him, but as soon as you hit a real world problem, you go blank? Almost always, huh?</p>
    <p>This happens because you are too busy copying the code and not really understanding what is happening under the hood</p>
    <p>For example, look at the code snippet below</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            var http = require('http');
            http.createServer(function(req, res){
                res.writeHead(200, {'content-type':'text/plain'});
                res.end('Hello World\n');
            }).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This is the starting point of almost every nodeJS server. If you write this code, you will easily fire up a server. However, you do not still understand what is happening in this code. You might get a slight idea, but you are still a long way from understanding it.</p>
    <p>We will take a few steps back and come back to this code to understand what's happening here</p>
    <p class="note">Note: we will focus on your Javascript as well. The better Javascript coder you are, the better NnodeJS coder you will become</p>
