    <h1>The command line interface</h1>
    <p>We normally use the GUI to perform our day to day operations in our operating system. There is another way to do this - the CLI. You type the commands in the CLI rather than click in GUI</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Linux</h3>
            <div>Bash</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Mac</h3>
            <div>Terminal</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <div>Command prompt</div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can execute commands to check the list of folders or copy or do other stuff.</p>
    <h3>Arguments to commands</h3>
    <p>You can also pass arguments to your commands. Example:</p>
    <p>dir /w</p>
    <p>dir /all</p>
    <p>We can also pass multiple arguments if the command supports it. Example:</p>
    <p>dir /w /p</p>
    <h3>Windows powershell</h3>
    <p>Windows offers an advanced and powerful CLI called the power-shell. It has more available commands</p>
