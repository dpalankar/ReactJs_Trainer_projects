    <h1>Let's run our first JS program in Node</h1>
    <p> Head to: </p>
    <p><a href = "https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a></p>
    <p>If you do not have it installed already.</p>
    <p>Once installed, check for the node folder and fire up your node command prompt. Check the version number. You can have a version different from mine, but you should be able to run from an folder in windows. It should be added to your path variable. The version number should give you a version without getting an error.</p>
    <p>Let's run a few commands directly and then create a JS file and run the code</p>
    <p>We will always use this pattern - run one single JS file with node. There can be more JS files included in this one file, but there always has to be an entry point for node</p>
